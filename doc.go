/*
Package cuckoo provides a Cuckoo Filter, a Bloom filter replacement for approximated set-membership queries.

While Bloom filters are well-known space-efficient data structures to serve queries like "if item x is in a set?", they do not support deletion. Their variances to enable deletion (like counting Bloom filters) usually require much more space.

Cuckoo filters provide the ﬂexibility to add and remove items dynamically. A cuckoo filter is based on cuckoo hashing (and therefore named as cuckoo filter). It is essentially a cuckoo hash table storing each key's fingerprint. Cuckoo hash tables can be highly compact, thus a cuckoo filter could use less space than conventional Bloom ﬁlters, for applications that require low false positive rates (< 3%).

"Cuckoo Filter: Better Than Bloom" by Bin Fan, Dave Andersen and Michael Kaminsky
(https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dga/papers/cuckoo-conext2014.pdf)

Note:
This implementation uses a a static bucket size of 4 fingerprints and a fingerprint size of 1 byte based on my understanding of an optimal bucket/fingerprint/size ratio from the aforementioned paper.
